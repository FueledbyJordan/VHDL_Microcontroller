## To Use The Assembler
The file that holds the assembly instructions is instructions.asm
This file can be edited to the end user's liking.  The code is assembled by running

```shell
python assembler.py > top_level_file.vhd 
```

and then loading that file into the project files.  Then run the simulation.
